# untitled-horror-game
A public repository where I mess around with prototyping and designing a future horror game

This won't be a 3D AAA quality game, I might stick to 2D top-down RPG like over world.
The premise I'm working with right now, the player is "enslaved" by a powerful god-like entity
who at first appears benevolent and all-knowing; the player must perform tasks and "errands" by
the master entity. Eventually, the tasks will become more and more immoral and evil. As the
player performs tasks, and interacts with other less-powerful characters in the world, various
hints can be found to give the player the ability to eventually overthrow and defeat the evil
master.

I want to touch on and explore morally complex and ambigious topics in the game. I'll work on
fleshing out those details in the future.
